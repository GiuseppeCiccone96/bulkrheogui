Project "TO DO" list:
average curve: 
- check whether all curves have the same length. If yes, use normal average. If no, use med curve.
- fix bug for which average frequency plot is plotted backwards (freq in raw data is in descending order).
- allow user to save average curve data.
- allows user to add and remove curves from plot - HIGH PRIORITY.
